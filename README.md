# Task Manager Web API

PROJECT NOT FINISHED

Task Manager Web API Exercise:
Scenario:You're tasked with developing a Task Manager Web API. This API will handle tasks, their categories, and user access.
Requirements:
Task Management:
Create endpoints to manage tasks: create, read, update, delete tasks.
Each task should have a title, description, status, due date, and assigned user.
Implement different endpoints to perform CRUD operations on tasks.
Categories:
Tasks should belong to specific categories. Create endpoints to manage categories: create, read, update, delete categories.
Each category should have a name, description, and possibly other relevant details.
User Authentication and Authorization:
Implement a basic user authentication system. Users should be able to register, log in, and log out.
Users should only be able to access and modify tasks assigned to them or tasks marked as public.
Endpoints:
Use different endpoints and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different functionalities (e.g., /tasks, /categories, /users, etc.).
Ensure proper RESTful API practices in endpoint design and naming.
Data Storage:
Use a database (such as SQL Server or SQLite) to persist tasks, categories, and user information.
Define appropriate database tables, relationships, and use Entity Framework Core or another ORM for data access.
Validation and Error Handling:
Implement input validation for API requests and handle validation errors appropriately.
Create custom error messages and HTTP status codes for different scenarios.
Testing:
Write unit tests for your API endpoints to ensure they work as expected.
Consider using testing frameworks like xUnit or NUnit.
Documentation:
Provide clear API documentation using Swagger or similar tools. Document the available endpoints, request, and response formats.
Additional Challenge (Optional):
Implement additional features to make the API more sophisticated:
Sorting and filtering tasks.
Implement pagination for listing tasks.
Sending notifications or reminders for due tasks.
Implement role-based access control.
Incorporate logging and monitoring for API activities.
